GitHub:  https://github.com/thalissonvs/pydoll/  

It’s not magic, but it solves what matters:  
- Native bypass for reCAPTCHA v3 &amp; Cloudflare Turnstile (just click in the checkbox).  
- 100% async – because nobody has time to wait for requests.  
- Currently running in a critical project at work (translation: if it breaks, I get fired).  

FAQ (For the Skeptical):
- “Is this illegal?” → No, but I’m not your lawyer.  
- “Does it actually work?” → It’s been in production for 3 months, and I’m still employed.  
- “Why open-source?” → Because I suffered through building it, so you don’t have to (or you can help make it better).  

For those struggling with hCAPTCHA, native support is coming soon – drop a star ⭐ to support the cause ..."
2,Found proxyware on my son's PC. Time to admit where IPs come from.,nseavia71501,547,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1nxoype/found_proxyware_on_my_sons_pc_time_to_admit_where/,"Just uncovered something that hit far closer to home than expected, even as an experienced scraper. I’d appreciate any insight from others in the scraping community.

I’ve been in large-scale data automation for years. Most of my projects involve tens of millions of data points. I rely heavily on proxy infrastructure and routinely use thousands of IPs per project, primarily residential.

Last week, in what initially seemed unrelated, I needed to install some niche video plugins on my 11-year-old son’s Windows 11 laptop. Normally, I’d use something like MPC-HC with LAV Filters, but he wanted something quick and easy to install. Since I’ve used K-Lite Codec Pack off and on since the late 1990s without issue, I sent him the download link from their official site.

A few days later, while monitoring network traffic for a separate home project, I noticed his laptop was actively pushing outbound traffic on ports 4444 and 4650. Closer inspection showed nearly 25GB of data transferred in just ..."

5,How do big companies like Amazon hide their API calls,Firstboy11,399,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1kqhucx/how_do_big_companies_like_amazon_hide_their_api/,"Hello,

I am learning web scrapping and tried beautifulsoup and selenium to scrape. With bot detection and resources, I realized they aren't the most efficient ones and I can try using API calls instead to get the data. I, however, noticed that big companies like Amazon hide their API calls unlike small companies where I can see the JSON file from the request. 

I have looked at a few post, and some mentioned about encryption. How does it work? Is there any way to get around this? If so, how do I do that? I would appreciate if you could also point me out to any articles to improve my understanding on this matter.

Thank you...."

8,What I've Learned After 5 Years in the Web Scraping Trenches,Remote-Book-8616,377,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1kceext/what_ive_learned_after_5_years_in_the_web/,"After spending the last 5 years working with web scraping projects, I wanted to share some insights that might help others who are just getting started or facing common challenges.

**The biggest challenges I've faced:**

**1. Website Anti-Bot Measures**

These have gotten incredibly sophisticated. Simple requests with Python's requests library rarely work on modern sites anymore. I've had to adapt by using headless browsers, rotating proxies, and mimicking human behavior patterns.

**2. Maintenance Nightmare**

About 10-15% of my scrapers break EVERY WEEK due to website changes. This is the hidden cost nobody talks about - the ongoing maintenance. I've started implementing monitoring systems that alert me when data patterns change significantly.

**3. Resource Consumption**

Browser-based scraping (which is often necessary to handle JavaScript) is incredibly resource-intensive. What starts as a simple project can quickly require significant server resources when scaled.

1. Don't try putting scraping tools in Lambda. Just admit defeat!
2. Selenium is cool and talked about a lot, but Playwright/Puppeteer/hrequests are new and better.
3. Don't feel like you have to go with Python. The Node.JS scraping community is huge! And more modern advice than Selenium.
4. AI will likely teach you old tricks because it's trained on a lot of old data. Use Medium/google search with timeframe &lt; 1 year.
5. Scraping is about new tricks, as Cloudflare, etc block a lot of scraping tactics.
6. Playwright is super cool! A lot of MS coders brought on from Puppeteer, from what I heard. The stealth plugin doesn't work, however (most stealth plugins don't, in fact!)
7. Find out YOUR browser headers
8. Don't worry about fancy proxies, etc if you're scraping lots of sites at scale. Worry if you're scraping lots of data from one site, or regular data scraping from one site.
9. If ..."
