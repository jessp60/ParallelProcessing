Firstly this is going to be a long post to hopefully help people genuinely looking to commit to becoming a developer by sharing my story of how I went from absolutely zero knowledge of programming (as you can see by my post history) to landing my first python developer role.

Location: UK

To kick things off about a year ago I wasnt happy with the job(s) I was doing, long hours, very low pay, so I came across python by chance. Yes I admit the money was what attracted me alone to start off with as I am quite a money motivated person. Ofcourse I knew and still know it will be a long journey to reach the salaries offered but I have managed to finally get my first step on the ladder by landing a job as a python developer. Enough of the story, lets get on with it.

I will list all of the youtube playlists and channels I watched over and over again. 
Bear in mind whilst reading these books I did watch a lot of videos in between reading aswell!
What books I read, in order.

2,I solved a real life problem with python for the 1st time and I feel like a wizard,[deleted],2689,203,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/xy1swx/i_solved_a_real_life_problem_with_python_for_the/,"Okay, this is probably going to sound super dumb, but today I'm putting the finishing touches on a program that downloads a data file for me (into a folder of my choosing!!! this part tripped me up for a while) and renames it according to today's date and I feel like a goddamn SORCERESS.

I showed it to my boyfriend, and then I felt kinda sheepish, because like, okay, it's just a file but .... it's so incredible for me to just see it working!! I know it sounds simple, but I had to navigate around so many barriers to make it work, and now that I've mastered this, so many other amazing projects feel accessible and understandable to me.

I'm just so happy! It feels like all my hard work teaching myself this stuff has paid off. Just wanted to share with you guys. :)

**EDIT:** OMG, I am overwhelmed by the support of this community!! Thank you all so much for the kind words. If y'all want to take a look at my code, I pasted it here: [https://gist.github.com/POPULARWEB6231/9da87879de572b13e7..."

The online video course from the author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" (that's me) is free to sign up for this week. This sign up will give you life time access to the course. Just use the following link:

https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=SCHOOLS_OUT2

This course is made for complete beginners who have no experience programming. It's ""programming for office workers"" because it skips computer science and teaches you how to do practical tasks: web scraping, updating Excel spreadsheets, parsing PDFs and Word documents, sending out automated email and text notifications, controlling the mouse and keyboard, and more. If you're an experienced programming, you can skip the first half (which covers basic programming concepts) and directly learn about several useful modules for Python.

Its a real tool to have in your arsenal when things get tough.  Today was the first day I put it into use and it was all due to lurking around this subreddit from people helping out others.   

  


My manger felt like pissing me off at work right before the weekend today giving me a huge workload come 4PM.  I was tasked to combine a lot of information with multiple excel sheets that were not formatted alike and he wanted a report by 5PM.  I guess he was thinking I would be manually doing this by opening up each sheet and copying and pasting the information together.  Little did he know I've been reading about python and learning on the side.  The pandas library immediately sprung into my head saying this is going to be easy - dump the raw data frame clean it and merge it together afterwards.  I was not confident writing my own code but poking around with some help from chat gpt plus a bit of self knowledge i was able to finish..."

7,"After 5 years of learning Python as a hobby, yesterday I did my first contribution to an open source project!",marcovirtual,1986,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/he7vpy/after_5_years_of_learning_python_as_a_hobby/,"About 5 years ago I started to study programming on and off as a hobby. I love reading articles, posts and books about Python and AutoHotKey, and during these years I have done some webscraping projects and scripts for myself. Nothing too complicated, just enough code to do what I needed, and that's why I still consider myself a newbie.

As someone who uses lots of free open-source software, I always wondered if someday I would find an open source project I could actually contribute to. It could be anything, but finding something is just so difficult! Everywhere I looked, all the projects were either too complicated for a hobbyist programmer like me or used a programming language I do not know.

But this weekend I got lucky. As I was trying some packages (or plugins) for my favorite text editor (Sublime Text), I noticed that [**one of them**](https://github.com/akshaykumar90/sublime-font-cycler), which I use extensively, could be improved by adding a very simple feature.

9,Beginner's Python Cheat Sheets (updated),ehmatthes,1785,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/djqm6v/beginners_python_cheat_sheets_updated/,"Hi everyone! A few years ago I made a set of cheat sheets to go along with the first edition of Python Crash Course. I recently finished updating the cheat sheets to match the changes that were made to the second edition of the book. These sheets aim to remind you of Python's syntax, but they also include brief explanations of the concepts behind the syntax as well. These are all free to download, and they are not specific to the book - they should be helpful to many people, regardless of what your primary learning resource is. 

The first sheet provides an overview of many basic concepts in Python. Individual sheets cover lists, dictionaries, if statements and while loops, functions,  classes, and more. There are also library-specific cheat sheets for Pygame, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Django. You can download individual sheets, download a pdf that includes all the sheets in one document, or download a zip file that includes each sheet in a separate pdf file. Here's an [overview of all t..."
