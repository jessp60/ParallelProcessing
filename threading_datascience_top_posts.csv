3,Shout Out to All the Mediocre Data Scientists Out There,MrBurritoQuest,3621,266,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hohvgq/shout_out_to_all_the_mediocre_data_scientists_out/,"I've been lurking on this sub for a while now and all too often I see posts from people claiming they feel inadequate and then they go on to describe their stupid impressive background and experience. That's great and all but I'd like to move the spotlight to the rest of us for just a minute. Cheers to my fellow mediocre data scientists who don't work at FAANG companies, aren't pursing a PhD, don't publish papers, haven't won Kaggle competitions, and don't spend every waking hour improving their portfolio.  Even though we're nothing special, we still deserve some appreciation every once in a while.
